# Deploying a Quarkus application + Jaeger into Kubernetes

# TL;DR

We will explore how tools such as K6, Quarkus, Kubernetes, and Jaeger can help us perform a stress test simulating a promotion event locally.

You will learn:

- How to use K6
- How to use Qute with Quarkus
- How to build and deploy a Quarkus application into Kubernetes
- How to install Jaeger
- How to create and manage a Kubernetes created with KinD

## Imagine

Imagine that your company shares a QR code during a prominent TV program; the QR code will be displayed on the audience's TV screens for a few seconds.

You need to conduct a test beforehand to ensure the success of the campaign. It's crucial to verify that customers can access the webpage without delays. 

If you are utilizing microservices, it is crucial to ascertain the minimum number of instances needed to be prepared for upcoming loads - Keep in mind that scaling needs to occur fastly, as time is short and the volume of requests is high. Auto-scaling mechanisms may take time to scale, potentially resulting in the loss of customers. 

Basically, to get the necessary number of instances executing before the access load, we need to:

1. Execute the load test
2. Tune the system
3. Repeat

!!! info "Disclaimer"

    I decided to simulate this scenario because it recently occurred, providing an excellent opportunity to explore how to connect these tools effectively to achieve a specific goal.

## Stress testing

The behavior commented above is called **Stress testing**. In this type of testing, the system is exposed to sudden and intense traffic surges, maintains this traffic during a period of time and ramps down the quantity of requests.

## What toolings are necessary to test this behavior

### Observability

Let's think that we are using a microservice architecture, ok? 

> You shouldn't build a microservices architecture without having observability first.

I don't remember which book this is in, but I recall reading it once. And it makes total sense.

You need to know how many instances you currently have, the total number of incoming requests, so that you can make informed decisions and adjust your infrastructure according to the current needs.

Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic, Datadog, Jaeger, etc., can assist you in handling these aspects.

### K6

K6 is a amazing load testing tooling that can help us to test this behavior. 

You write your expectation using Javascript and execute it with a simple command:

```sh
k6 run script.js
```

You can simulate some types of load testing with K6:

![test-types](test-types.png)
> Reference: [K6 official documentation](https://k6.io/docs/test-types/load-test-types/) 

### Creating the script that simulates a stress test

As mentiones K6 uses Javascript language to write the expected test. Javascript is a useful script language, K6 provide a great API is extensible (You can create an extension). Even though JavaScript was used for writing K6 tests, it was implemented in GoLang, [embedding a JavaScript engine](https://github.com/dop251/goja) for easier test scripting.


```js linenums="1" hl_lines="5-6"
import http from "k6/http"

export const options = {
    stages: [
        { duration: '5s', target: 10000 },
        { duration: '60s', target: 10000 }
    ]
}

export default function() {
    http.get('http://localhost:8080/promotion/tv')
}
```

- **Line 5**: Stage 1 ramps up the target to 30000 over 5 seconds. This simulates the customers getting their phones to scan the QR Code.
- **Line 6**: Stage 2 ramps up the target to 31000 over 60 seconds. This simulates the continuous traffic during 1 minute.

## A scalable system

There are various methods, tools, architectures, and strategies for achieving a scalable system. Options include virtualization, containers, load balancing, CDNs, and microservices, among others. In this simulation, we will employ a container orchestrator, specifically Kubernetes, to simulate the three steps required to determine the minimum instances necessary for our load testing.

## Hands-on

We will create a cluster Kuberntes with KinD, deploy our Quarkus application into the cluster, and execute the K6 script targeting our applications.

### Creating the Kubernetes cluster

We will create a Kubernetes cluster with Kubernetes in Docker (KinD), as the name said, KinD aims to execute a cluster Kubernetes inside docker.

Our Kubernetes cluster will have 1 control plane and 3 workers nodes!

```sh
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --name dev --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
EOF
```

After running the command, the ouput should seems like it:

??? info "The ouput should looks like it."

    ```sh
    Creating cluster "dev" ...
    ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.26.3) 🖼
    ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 📦 📦 📦

    ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 
    ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
    ✓ Joining worker nodes 🚜 
    Set kubectl context to "kind-dev"
    You can now use your cluster with:

    kubectl cluster-info --context kind-dev

    Have a nice day! 👋
    ```

### Installing Jaeger Operator

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: jaeger-operator-in-myproject
  namespace: myproject
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: jaeger-operator
  namespace: observability
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: jaeger-operator
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### Creating the Quarkus application

We will use Quarkus because is very simple to deploy an application into Kubernetes, we will use Quarkus CLI to deploy the application.

Let's create the Quarkus application with all necessary extensions:

```sh
quarkus create app com.github.mcruzdev:k6-with-quarkus --extension='quarkus-opentelemetry,resteasy-reactive,quarkus-resteasy-reactive-qute'
```

??? info "The ouput should looks like it."

    ```sh
      -----------
      selected extensions: 
      - io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive
      - io.quarkus:quarkus-opentelemetry
      - io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive-qute

      -----------
      [SUCCESS] ✅  quarkus project has been successfully generated in:
      --> /home/cruz/k6-with-quarkus
    ```

### Creating the template with Qute

```html linenums="1" hl_lines="3 15"
<!-- src/main/resources/templates/promotion.html -->

{@java.lang.String cupom} <!--1-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

    <title>TV Promotion simulation with K6 and Quarkus</title>
</head>
<body class="h-screen w-screen flex flex-row items-center justify-center">
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">
        Cupom applied! Your cupom is <span class="text-blue-900">{cupom}</span>! <!--2-->
    </h1>
</body>
</html>
```

1. At line **"3"**, we are declaring the Qute template parameter `cupom` as String.
2. At line **"15"**, we are using the data `cupom` data inside the template.

### Creating the `/promotion/tv` page

```java linenums="1" hl_lines="17"
package dev.matheuscruz;

import java.util.UUID;

import io.quarkus.qute.Template;
import io.quarkus.qute.TemplateInstance;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/promotion")
public class PromotionResource {

    @Inject
    Template promotion; // (1)

    @GET
    @Path("/tv")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
    public TemplateInstance tv() {
        return promotion.data(
                "cupom", UUID.randomUUID().toString()); // (2)
    }

}
```

1. Quarkus injects the `Template` instance and maps the field name to a HTML file in `src/main/resources/promotion.html`. If you change the field `promotion` to `promo`, you need to change the `promotion.html` file name to `promo.html`.  You can use the `@io.quarkus.qute.Location` annotation to specify the file inside `src/main/resources` directory, in other words, with this annotation you can change the field name without change the HTML file in the resource directory.
2. Here, we are using the `Template` instance passing a data `"cupom"` (as String) to the template to get a `TemplateInstace` object.

If you run the application with `quarkus dev`, and access [here](http://localhost:8080/promotion/tv), the output should looks something like this:

![promotion-page](image.png)


### Creating a Docker image with Jib

Quarkus offers some extensions to build an push container images to container registry, [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) is one of them.

You just need to add the jib extension and configure the application.properties to build the container image on building.

Add the following dependency into the `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<!-- pom.xml -->
<dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-container-image-jib</artifactId>
    </dependency>
```

Add the following property into `application.properties` file.

```properties
quarkus.container-image.build=true
```

??? tip "Changing the container image info"

    By default, Quarkus uses your system username to generate the image group. To change it, Quarkus offers some configurations to change the image name info:

    ```properties
    quarkus.container-image.group=your-group
    quarkus.container-image.name=k6-with-quarkus
    quarkus.container-image.tag=1.0-version-here
    ```


After this configuration, let's build our image:

```sh
quarkus build
```

We can view the result running:
```sh
docker images | grep k6-with-quarkus

matheuscruzdev/k6-with-quarkus  1.0 3ee7138f017a  23 seconds ago  429MB
```

Let's push our image to Docker Registry:

```sh
docker push matheuscruzdev/k6-with-quarkus:1.0 
```

Quarkus offers it for us, see [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#defining-a-docker-registry).

### Adding Kubernetes extension

Quarkus allows us to create a Kubernetes resources based in our application. Is possible to generate specific resources for KinD, Kubernetes, OpenShift and Knative.

Let's install the Quarkus extension for KinD:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-kind</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After installing, we just need to deploy our application:

```sh
quarkus build
```

And apply the generated Kubernetes resources to our KinD cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f target/kubernetes/kind.yml
```

??? tip "Using `quarkus deploy`"

    You can use `quarkus deploy` command to deploy your application into KinD cluster. Is necessary to configure the `quarkus.kubernetes.namespace=default` into application.properties.

If we execute a `kubectl get deployments` command, we can see the following output:

```sh
NAME              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
k6-with-quarkus   1/1     1            1           24m
```

### Starting our Testing

Before, creating our test, we need to define the our goals. **We want that 95% of requests fall below 200ms of duration**, this is measured by the `p(95)` metric. 


Let's thought that we are expecting a load of 10.000 RPS during 60 seconds.

A best practice is to start with a small load, feel the system, and grow up using steb-by-step approach.

For this scenario we will break the test into 3 stages. After every stage I will change the quantity of replicas necessary for our `Deployment` object.

### Results

  - target: 7500
